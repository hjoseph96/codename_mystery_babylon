Welcome to Aesthetico asset. It allows you to pixelate and color grade camera's image output.

Structure:

	/Aesthetico - main directory
		/Core - contains core asset files (required for proper working)
		/Demo - contains demo scene and example scripts for Aesthetico usage (not required for proper working)
		
To start using Aesthetico simply add Aesthetico component on your Camera GameObject.
If you want to write custom scripts using Aesthetico features remember to use ToucanSystems namespace.
In order to have Aesthetico working in build you should add Aesthetico.shader to 'Always Included Shaders' in Graphics Settings.

ENJOY!
