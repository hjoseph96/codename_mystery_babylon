# DecisionFlex v1.4                         {#index}

DecisionFlex is a lightweight, unobtrusive and designer-driven system for automating human-like decsions in Unity games. It is ideally suited to decisions with multiple choices that need to take into account several variables. For example, selecting a golf club based on ball lie and distance to target, or choosing weapon based on target type, distance and ammo count.

DecisionFlex is good because:  
- is a lot easier to reason about than a huge IF-ELSE block
- decisions are set up and managed from the editor
- non-coders can set up decisions
- more accurately represents real-world decision making
